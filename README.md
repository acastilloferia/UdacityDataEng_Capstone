# UdacityDataEng_Capstone
Udacity Capstone Project for Data Engineer Nanodegree
I have decided to explore Udacity given Data Sets:
* File 1
* File 2
* airport_codes_csv.csv
* Filee 4

### Airport Codes File
I have inspected this file using Pandas Dataframe. I have perfomed the following steps:
* Split coordinates field into latitude & longitude (following standard notation).
* Filter only *US* airports  
* Populate *ident* information when *na* in *gps_code*, *iata_code* (3-char) and *local_code** Default *elevation*
* Default *elevation* as 0.0
* Extract *state_code* from *us-region* (US-xx)
* Create an unique *city_code* with municipality_state_code.
* Drop duplicates
* Save to parquet (overwrite mode) to outdata_path+"airports/airports.parquet"
