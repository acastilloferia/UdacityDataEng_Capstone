# UdacityDataEng_Capstone
Udacity Capstone Project for Data Engineer Nanodegree
I have decided to explore Udacity given Data Sets:
* File 1
* File 2
* airport_codes_csv.csv
* File 4

## Airport Codes File
I have inspected this file using Pandas Dataframe. I have perfomed the following steps:
* Split coordinates field into latitude & longitude (following standard notation).
* Filter only *US* airports 
* Populate *ident* information when *na* in *gps_code*, *iata_code* (3-char) and *local_code*
